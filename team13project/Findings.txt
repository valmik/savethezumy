Upgrading the UR5 files on the computer to 1.1.6 from 1.0.2 allowed us to use the limited motion version of moveit without errors.

Limited sets joints to only move -pi to pi instead of -2pi to 2pi, this supposedly makes moveit behave better.

Gazebo lets you simulate the robot. This publishes the same as if the robot was running, and you can visualize the movements without breaking stuff.

/ur_ws/src/unviersal_robot/readme.md has useful instructions for starting moveit, simulations, rviz.

Launching limited sim, limited moveit, and rviz:
roslaunch ur_gazebo ur5.launch limited:=true
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch sim:=true limited:=true
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true

Starting up limited robot comms, limited moveit, and rviz
YOU MUST ENABLE ROBOT ON CONTROLLER.
roslaunch ur_modern_driver ur5_bringup_joint_limited.launch robot_ip:=192.168.1.222
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config ur5_moveit_planning_execution.launch limited:=true
roslaunch ur5_moveit_config moveit_rviz.launch config:=true 

Force sensor, a grad student wrote doc showing how to get data out, need his code.

SRDF file defines all the joints and joint groups.

Trying to make an startRobotSim file that starts all the roslaunches. Can someone make it so it can actually run all 3 in parallel?

To run our test code rosrun savethezumy path_test_ur5.py

ISSUES/WHAT WE NEED HELP ON:

1) Force Sensor hook up
2) running test_move.py (sudo rosdep init)
3) Orietation constraints in MoveIt
4) What is frame_id in MoveIt?
5) Command to set planning attempts in MoveIt

ANSWERS

1) ur_modern_driver used by test_move.py! Get Dexter to chage it!
2) Shivani will get code from group with Zumy pickup

ee_link touching ar_marker_2 on base to base transform:
- Translation: [-0.215, 0.191, 0.012]
- Rotation: in Quaternion [0.614, -0.373, -0.588, -0.371]
            in RPY (radian) [-2.642, 1.533, -0.609]
            in RPY (degree) [-151.395, 87.838, -34.915]

MAIN TASKS CHRIS:

1) Make subscribers
2) Alter F/T Sensor files for continuous data streaming to topic
3) Buy correct size bolts to not mess up sensor
