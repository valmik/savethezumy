This is the ROS workspace for my EECS 106A project: Save The Zumy. I partnered with Eric Noordam, Chris Berthelet, and Mimi Parker, and completed the project during Fall 2016. The website for the project is located at http://savethezumy.weebly.com/.

Parts I worked on included:
All the kinematics, including PKproblems.py, kinematics.py, and kinematics_tester.py
Most of the zumy stuff, including zumy.py and zumytester.py
Much of the force-sensing code, and some of the UR5 movement infrastructure, which are included in main_UR5.py and grid_traversal.py
